## Overview

The SNHU Computer Science Capstone gives graduating students an opportunity to showcase their proficiency in the Computer Science field. This ePortfolio represents a combination of the knowledge developed throughtout the courses in the Computer Science program and the practical skills gained from ten years of experience I've accumulated as an engineer.

## Professional Assessment

The Computer Science program at SNHU has been a wonderful experience that has helped me develop and reinforce my expertise in the industry in a number of ways, the most impactful being that I have greatly expanded my understanding of many of the more fundamental concepts of Computer Science that I was previously lacking. A few great examples of this would include the underlying memory structures and pointer functionality that enables the traversal of list types and how instructions and data are passed between memory and processor registers. The program does a great job of introducing various aspects of working on a team along with some of the inherit challenges such as managing a code base and how concepts such as source control systems can be employed to help alleviate some of those difficulties. It also teaches students how SDLC paradigms such as Agile and Waterfall and some of their artifacts such as User Stories, Product Backlog Items (PBIs), or Functional and Technical design documents can be used to gather and refine requirements and set mutually understood expectations with stakeholders, various user groups, and project managers. I also enjoyed the opportunity to refamiliarize myself with software design and architecture tools such as sequence diagrams and UML since I hadn't utilized them as much having been in a developer role, but saw increased need to produce these types of artifacts in my current role as an architect.

## Summary

The direction I decided to take my Capstone work was to start with the project from the CS-340: Client/Server Development course and re-architect, rebuild, and then incrementally introduce enhancements that model the program outcomes highlighted by the Capstone course. The delivery of the project consists of four milestones. The first milestone is informal code review. During this code review, the issues that will be addressed are brought to light and it lays a ground work for the remaining three milestones. The second milestone builds a basic system architecture following industry established best practices and OOP principles. The second milestone extends that architecture with some basic alogorithms that showcase how these best practices also allow for components within the application's architecture to be extended, enhanced, or replaced without the need to rewrite every element of the system.
