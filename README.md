# CS-499

This repo houses the artifacts produced as the various milestones for Capstone course of SNHU's BS in Computer Science class. While progressing through the work, I used [Azure DevOps](https://mikedarling.visualstudio.com/CS499) to host the repository and set up CI/CD. The application was deployed to a serverless App Service to host the site at [this link](http://grazioso.azurewebsites.net/).
